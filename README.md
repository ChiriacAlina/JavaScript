# JavaScript
During the JavaScript course I learned about how to:
• Declare and initialize variables
• Control execution with decisions and loops
• Use functions, callbacks, fat arrow functions
• Use objects and classes
• Use inheritance
• Use JSON
• Use collections: Array, Map and Set
• Use destructuring, spread operator and rest parameter
• Work with DOM and BOM
• Use HTML templates
• Add event handlers and timers
• Use exceptions
• Use promises
• Use iterators and generators
• Use strings and regular expressions
• Trace execution and debug code
