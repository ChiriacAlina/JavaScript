# JavaScript
During the JavaScript course I learned about how to:

• Declare and initialize variables

• Use functions, callbacks, fat arrow functions

• Use objects and classes

• Use HTML templates

• Add event handlers and timers

• Use exceptions

• Use promises

• Trace execution and debug code

**Please check the Master Branch for examples.**
