# JavaScript
During the JavaScript course I learned about how to:

• Declare and initialize variables

• Control execution with decisions and loops

• Use functions, callbacks, fat arrow functions

• Use objects and classes

• Use JSON

• Use collections: Array, Map and Set

• Work with DOM and BOM

• Use HTML templates

• Add event handlers and timers

• Use exceptions

• Use promises

• Trace execution and debug code
